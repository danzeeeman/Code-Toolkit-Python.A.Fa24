## Week 1 — Class notes

### One on One
I'm going to do 1:Ones with everyone in the class periodically throughout the semester.  These informal chats will help me gage progress, help with confusion, and help me get to know each of you a bit better. 

### Office Hours
Office hours will be on-demand this semester.  I'm usually available during the day except for some standing meetings I have at my day job at 12:30pm-2:00pm.  If you send me an email or discord message I will usually get back to you soon.  I basically live in front of a multiple computers so if I'm not getting back to you promptly its because I'm on a call, asleep, or out.

### [Discord](https://discord.gg/X6zWtZZ9)
I invited you all to our discord server.  If I have missed anyone please let me know right now!  Please sign up as it is a way to contact me directly about issues with homework or readings (or anything else y'all wanna chat about).

### Introduction

#### Background, context, and goals
At its core, the objective of this class is to teach you how to create software with python, and in the process to uncover how an embodied, hands-on practice creating software affords you new insights into how software operates unto itself, and how it interfaces with the world by shaping and mediating other social and cultural activities.

Hopefully in some of your other classes at The New School, you've had the opportunity to study critical perspectives on what software & digital machinery have wrought in the world: how they mediate so many social, cultural, political and economic aspects of life today. In this class, we will augment these critical perspectives by emphasizing production work to learn first-hand what software does, how it operates, and how it makes us think. By learning how to develop software yourself through the practice of computer programming, you will gain an intimate understanding of the core building blocks that comprise nearly all software in use today.

There are some programming techniques that you will learn in this class that won't be directly applicable to all of your future coding work (like specific programming language syntax), but hopefully everything that you learn will be applicable to future work in the sense that you will be learning the core constructs of computer programming in a foundational sense. Later on when working with other technical production tools, you should be able to recognize these core constructs such as: if statements, loops, arrays, and fundamental concepts of computation like variability and repetition.

In learning how to create computer programs, you will experience the thought processes and ideologies that come with software thinking — we might say, software epistemology. You will experience what it is like to discipline your mind into thinking like a computer programmer, which, oddly, also entails disciplining your mind into "thinking" like a computer — although whether we can call what computers do thinking is the subject of deep, long-standing, political, and philosophical debate. Understanding these core building blocks of computer programs then is a way of seeing how a world mediated by software appears, or more metaphorically, we might say: how computers see the world.

In a world that seems everywhere mediated by software, these skills are valuable in their own right. But beyond the utility or "marketable skills" of this practice, hopefully you will gain hands-on knowledge that you can bring back to other critical studies of the social, cultural, and political aspects of computer programs.

So ... *what is a computer program?*

Its kind of like a recipe, where the computer is the chef.

A program is a file, like a text or .doc file. (What is a file?) It lives on your computer's disk, it consists of a series of instructions, and its formatted in a precise, special way so that your computer can read and execute the instructions listed in the file.

So when we say for example that a program is "big", it just means it consists of more instructions, so its a larger file, or multiple files.

What are some computer programs?
* Microsoft Word
* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe Illustrator
* Firefox
* your favorite game
* Gmail

So what is computer programming?

The art or science of writing specific computer instructions for a specific task

Often called just "programming", or "coding"

Programming is a kind of translation. From the intuitive and informal way that humans communicate to each other, into a formal and very specific type of writing. This often entails describing the task in a very structured way in English, and then translating that description into a computer programming language.
Another word for this is algorithm. An algorithm is a formal process or a sequence of instructions. (Anyone know where this word comes from?) Think of some

## Part 1 :: It's all about the tokens
### Tokenizers 

_what is a tokenizer?_

Tokenizers break up _words_, _parts of words_ and _phrases_ into a unique token that the software can recognize.  

Some tokenizers work by splitting up a sentence or phrase based of the spaces between words but some tokenizers take a more machine centered approach and split them up by bytes.

![Tokenizers](img/Tokenizer.jpg)

In the computer world everything is made of of bits and bytes. Have you heard of the phrase Megabits and Megabytes.  Some people would want you to believe they are the same thing but they aren't. 

- a _bit_ is a single binary number a 0 or a 1
- a _byte_ is made up of 8 _bits_

The difference between a megabit and a megabyte is 7 million bits. 

The way a byte level tokenizer works is that it splits up a sentence or a phrase or a paragraph by the individual bytes.  If a word is really long it takes up more bytes in memory therefore it has more tokens.  

Lets look at how a tokenizer works by looking at the openAI GPT3 tokenizer and feed it some phrases: [link](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer)

![Tokenizer](images/tokenizer.PNG)

If we turn on show _token id_ we can see the unique identifier for each word in the GPT3 tokenizer.

![Token ID](images/token-id.PNG)

Let run the word _somewhere_ through the system.  Some would assume that it would have a single unique identifier. But it doesn't!

![Somewhere](images/somewhere.PNG)

As you can see the word is actually 3 different tokens. the letter _s_ the suffix _ome_ and the word _here_

Let look at this diagram for the steps for feeding a phrase into a tokenizer and then into a model.

![Tokenizer Steps](images/tokenizer_steps.png)

The goal of tokenizers is to transform natural language into something a computer can understand and perform math operations on:


So these bit of code

```
raw_inputs = [
    "I've been waiting for this blog my whole life.",
    "I hate this so much!",
]
inputs = tokenizer(raw_inputs, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="tf")
```

will turn the phrases:

- _"I've been waiting for this blog my whole life."_
- _"I hate this so much!"_

into this Tensor that the computer can understand

```
{
    'input_ids': <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 16), dtype=int32, numpy=
        array([
            [  101,  1045,  1005,  2310,  2042,  3403,  2005,  1037, 17662, 12172,  2607,  2026,  2878,  2166,  1012,   102],
            [  101,  1045,  5223,  2023,  2061,  2172,   999,   102,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0]
        ], dtype=int32)>, 
    'attention_mask': <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 16), dtype=int32, numpy=
        array([
            [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
            [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        ], dtype=int32)>
}
```

### What does this all Mean?

I know there is a lot to unpack in the above snippet and we won't get into that yet.  You're probably confused and wondering why I'm telling you all of this, but it will make sense shortly.

Lets look at phone numbers!

(Country Code)-(Area Code)-(Exchange)-(Extension)

so something like:

+1-917-XXX-XXXX

_this is when I give you my cell phone number for emergencies only_ 

So if you think about a phone number here in the states, it is a set of eleven numbers that make up 4 different tokens, the country code is a unique token to everyone in the States, the area code is unique token to everyone in that area, the exchange is a unique token to everyone in that exchange, and the last four digits, is your extension token in the exchange in the area code in the country code.  So that when you put those eleven digits in the correct order, it create a unique address to your phone.  

For generative AI think about this tokens as the parts that make up the address of the output you want.  It's a multi-dimensional location inside the latent space of the network.

### _DAN! WTF IS LATENT SPACE???_

![latent space](images/latent_space.png)

![damn](images/hold_up.gif)

Latent Space is the multi-dimensional space that makes up the 'knowledge' of Generative AI. 

Think of it as a complex space where each unique item is nearby similar items. In the figure above we see all of the items of the same color grouped together.  But because it is more than 3 dimensions (its just represented in 3 dimensions here) some of the blue dots could contain information that is similar to the pink dots and are close to them as well on that 4th, 5th, or Nth dimension. 

Sometimes we project it down to 2D space with a dimensional reduction step to make it easier to see

![tsne](images/latent_space_tsne.jpg)

_DAN! WTF is DIMENSIONAL REDUCTION??_

Dimensional reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much of the important information as possible

You can see here when we project this representation of latent space down to 2D some of the red dots are mixed in with the green dots, that is because they contain similar data points and should be near each other

![laten_space_gif](images/PCA_Projection_Illustration.gif)

### Putting it all together

 Each type of generative AI has its own unique tokenizer (or well a lot of them use the same one lol) that translates the natural language prompts you supply into an array of numbers that represent the _address_ of what you are looking for inside the _model_ of the generative AI.  This address is a unique identifier for a location inside the latent space of the AI model's _knowledge_ of what it has been trained on. 


## Part 2 :: Prompting  

So all of these prompts will give me different results because they describe the image I want differently:

```a poster of a black and white hightop sneaker, nike air jordan 1```

![PHOTO](images/sd/00156-2275035574.png)

```a black and white photo of an nike air jordan 1 poster```

![PHOTO](images/sd/00157-2275035574.png)

```a hightop nike air jordan 1, black and white, poster```

![PHOTO](images/sd/00158-2275035574.png)

You can see how building on top of a prompt can narrow your search to what you are looking for in the AI Mines:

```a poster of a black and white nike air jordan 1 hightop sneaker```

![PHOTO](images/sd/00159-2275035574.png)

```a poster of a black and white nike air jordan 1 hightop sneaker, product shot, wide angle, on foot```

![PHOTO](images/sd/00160-2275035574.png)

```a poster of a black and white nike air jordan 1 hightop sneaker, product shot, wide angle, on foot, pink background, high res, studio lighting```

![PHOTO](images/sd/00161-2275035574.png)

Each of these prompts narrows your search inside the latent space to reveal what you are looking for. 

So lets look at some rules:
### Key Phrases and Constraints 

What is the difference between these two statements:

  ```Please give me the history of the united states```

  ```Please give me the history of the united states in 3 sentences```

### Chain-of-Thought

_Make it a run on sentence that describes everything in detail_

(I haven't tried these prompt we're going in cold)

```write a short story about the time my friend jack and I went over the hill and through the woods to find a rocket in a secret cave that was a government army base that was 13 stories deep but jack fell at the opening of the cave I had to save him and We escaped with the Alien```

_Over the Hill and Through the Woods: A Journey to the Secret Cave_
---

_Once upon a time, in a small town nestled between rolling hills and dense woods, lived two adventurous friends, Jack and the storyteller. Their curious hearts were always seeking excitement and thrill, and one sunny morning, they stumbled upon a mysterious map tucked away in the attic of an old abandoned house. The map revealed the location of a secret cave, rumored to hold a hidden rocket and the entrance to a government army base buried 13 stories deep underground.

Eyes wide with wonder, Jack and the storyteller decided to embark on an unforgettable journey to uncover the secrets of the cave. With the map clutched tightly in their hands, they set off over the hill and through the woods, the beauty of nature surrounding them.

As they trudged through the undergrowth, Jack's excitement was infectious. He spoke of flying to the stars in the rocket, exploring new galaxies, and making friends with extraterrestrial beings. The storyteller couldn't help but catch his friend's enthusiasm, their dreams intertwining like vines in the forest.

As the sun began its descent, casting long shadows across the landscape, they finally reached the foot of the hill where the cave's entrance lay hidden. The cave's mouth was dark and foreboding, but Jack's enthusiasm knew no bounds. He rushed ahead, and in his eagerness, he stumbled and fell hard, gasping in pain as he clutched his ankle.

Worry and fear etched on the storyteller's face, they rushed to Jack's side. He couldn't walk, and the cave's secrets seemed even more elusive than ever. But the storyteller was determined not to let their adventure end in disappointment.

With grit and determination, the storyteller helped Jack up, and with his arm around his friend's shoulder, they hobbled into the cave together. As they descended, the darkness engulfed them, and the air grew colder, but the faint sound of mechanical hums reassured them they were on the right path.

At last, they reached the 13th floor, where they encountered the true wonders hidden within the cave. It wasn't just a rocket; it was an advanced spacecraft of extraterrestrial origin, left behind by an alien race that had visited Earth long ago. The government had been studying it secretly for years.

Amidst the alien technology, Jack and the storyteller made a startling discovery. A friendly alien creature, small and shimmering, had been left behind, trapped in the cave for decades. It communicated with them through a series of mesmerizing colors and gentle hums, and despite their initial shock, they soon felt a profound connection with the being.

As they marveled at the wonders before them, they also stumbled upon confidential files detailing the government's secret experiments. Feeling a sense of responsibility, Jack and the storyteller decided to share this information with the world, believing that such advanced technology and knowledge should be used for the betterment of humankind, not hidden away in secrecy.

But their noble intentions put them in danger. The government discovered their presence and began to hunt them down. With the alien's help, they navigated through the twists and turns of the secret cave and made their escape, just barely evading capture.

With the alien now by their side, they returned to their small town, determined to protect their new friend and ensure the world knew the truth about the secrets hidden beneath the hill and through the woods.

From that day forward, Jack and the storyteller became local legends. Their friendship and bravery were admired, and their tale of the alien in the secret cave sparked debates and discussions across the world. But they remained humble, knowing that the real heroes were the ones who dared to seek the unknown and stand up for what they believed in.

And so, their adventure left an indelible mark on their hearts and minds, reminding them that the most extraordinary things often lie just over the hill and through the woods._
