### _Who?_
I'm Dan Moore [he/him], I'm an Artist, Designer, and Technologist based here in New York City.  I design and build interactive activations and applications.  

I currently work with Artificial Intelligence to investigate pop culture. I have most recently exhibited at the Vancouver Art Gallery during THE IMITATION GAME: VISUAL CULTURE IN THE AGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.  I hold a Masters of Tangible Interaction Design from Carnegie Mellon’s College of Fine Art, where I studied and worked in the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry.  I was a virtual research fellow in the Free Art and Technology, F.A.T., Lab. I'm an adjunct professor at The New School.

Recently, I've been creating sneakers with machine learning and calling them [*airegan](www.aire-gan.com)

I've worked at an experimentals UX design studio inside Samsung Mobile. I led a team at Squarespace doing conceptual product design.  I did a couple tour's of duty at the Google Creative Lab where I led the development of [_Just A Line_](https://justaline.withgoogle.com), prototyped an early version of [_Verne_](https://verne.withgoogle.com), developed the [_Morse Code gBoard_](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9011881?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid), and prototyped the [_Notable Women_](https://notablewomen.withgoogle.com) AR experience.  I've worked with advertising agencies, experiential agencies, and architecture firms to build interactive installations such as creating a video game played with a car, an F1 driver, and a Passenger with an iPad for a campaign called [_Trace Your Road_](https://vimeo.com/74125559).  I'm currently fulltime with NVIDIA working with their creative team on tools and workflows for virtual production, including realtime motion capture and robotic arm integrations.
